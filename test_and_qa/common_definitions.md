## Common definitions used in testing and quality assurance

**Dependability** - The quality of a delivered service such that reliance can justifiably be placed on the service.  

**Error** - The part of the system or service that can lead to failure. This is usually, but not always some part of the code in a software product. 

**Failure** - Unwanted effects that occur when the delivered service deviates from the specification of the expected service.  

**Fault/Defect/Bug** - The root cause of an error.  Faults may be caused by poor requirements specification, design flaws, manufacturing defects, wear and tear on hardware such as damage or short circuits, and coding mistakes in software.

**Latent Error** - An error that exists but does not necessarily cause a failure.  It usually remains dormant until it is triggered by running the portion of the code where it resides resulting in failure.  

**Effective Error** - An error that results in noticeable system failure or deviation from expected behavior.  Unlike latent errors, effective errors manifest as active (that is noticeable) failure.

**Service** - The system behavior as perceived by the user.  

**Reliability** - The likelihood an end user will encounter a fault that triggers an error leading to failure.  The more reliable the delivered service is, the less likely an end user is to encounter faults or experience failures.
