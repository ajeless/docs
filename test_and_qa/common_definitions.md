# Definitions used in testing and quality assurance

## B
- **Black Box Testing**: A software testing method where the tester does not have knowledge of the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested. It focuses solely on testing the software's functionality based on its requirements.
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Testing the software with input values at the boundary limits.
- **Branch Coverage**: Ensuring each branch (decision) in the software is executed at least once.

## D
- **Decision Table Testing**: Testing the software's behavior for different input combinations in a table format.
- **Dependability**: The quality of a delivered service such that reliance can justifiably be placed on the service.

## E
- **Effective Error**: An error that results in noticeable system failure or deviation from expected behavior. Unlike latent errors, effective errors manifest as active (that is noticeable) failure.
- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Dividing the input data of a software unit into partitions of equivalent data from which test cases can be derived.
- **Error**: The part of the system or service that can lead to failure. This is usually, but not always some part of the code in a software product.

## F
- **Failure**: Unwanted effects that occur when the delivered service deviates from the specification of the expected service.
- **Fault/Defect/Bug**: The root cause of an error. Faults may be caused by poor requirements specification, design flaws, manufacturing defects, wear and tear on hardware such as damage or short circuits, and coding mistakes in software.

## G
- **Grey Box Testing**: A software testing method that merges both black box and white box testing techniques, where the tester has partial knowledge of the software's internal workings.

## L
- **Latent Error**: An error that exists but does not necessarily cause a failure. It usually remains dormant until it is triggered by running the portion of the code where it resides resulting in failure.
- **Loop Testing**: Testing the loops in the software to ensure they work as expected.

## M
- **Matrix Testing**: Identifying all the variables of an application and then testing them in pairs.

## O
- **Orthogonal Array Testing**: A systematic, statistical way of testing which involves pair-wise testing.

## P
- **Path Coverage**: Ensuring all paths in the software are executed at least once.
- **Pattern Testing**: Testing the software based on predefined patterns.

## R
- **Regression Testing**: Ensuring that new changes in the software have not affected the existing functionalities.
- **Reliability**: The likelihood an end user will encounter a fault that triggers an error leading to failure.

## S
- **Service**: The system behavior as perceived by the user.
- **State Transition Testing**: Testing the software's behavior for different states and transitions between those states.
- **Statement Coverage**: Ensuring each statement in the software is executed at least once.

## W
- **White Box (or Glassbox) Testing**: A software testing method where the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester. It focuses on checking the internal logic, pathways, and code structure of the software.
