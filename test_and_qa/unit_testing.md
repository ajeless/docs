# Unit Testing and Test Doubles

Unit testing involves testing individual units or components of software in isolation to ensure they function as intended. To achieve this isolation, "test doubles" are used to simulate the behavior of real components.

## Test Doubles
**Definition:** Test doubles are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways, allowing for effective isolation of the system under test (SUT).

### 1. Stubs
**Definition:** Stubs provide predetermined responses to calls made during the test.

**Example:** Imagine a method that fetches user data from a database. In testing, instead of querying the actual database, a stub could be used to return a fixed set of user data.

### 2. Dummies
**Definition:** Dummies are placeholders that don't have any behavior. They're used to fill parameter lists.

**Example:** If a method requires a user object as a parameter but doesn't actually use it for the specific test scenario, a dummy user object might be passed just to satisfy the method's signature.

### 3. Spies
**Definition:** Spies are like stubs, but they also record some information about how they were called, allowing for further verification.

**Example:** Imagine a method that sends notifications to users. A spy could be used to simulate the notification sender and record how many times it was called and with what messages.

### 4. Mocks
**Definition:** Mocks are objects pre-programmed with expectations regarding the order and arguments of their method calls. They can throw exceptions if they receive calls they weren't expecting.

**Example:** For a method that processes payments, a mock payment gateway could be set up to expect a payment of a specific amount. If the method tries to process a different amount, the mock would raise an exception.

### 5. Fakes
**Definition:** Fakes have a working implementation, but it's simplified and not suitable for production.

**Example:** Instead of using a real database, a fake in-memory database could be used for testing. It behaves like a real database but doesn't persist data beyond the test's lifecycle.

## Fixtures
**Definition:** Fixtures set up a fixed environment or state for tests to run in. They ensure tests have a consistent starting point and aren't affected by external factors.

**Example:** Before testing CRUD operations, a fixture might set up a database with a known set of data. After the tests, another fixture might clean up by deleting any data added during the tests.

In conclusion, while unit testing ensures software components work as expected, test doubles are essential tools in a tester's arsenal. They provide controlled environments and behaviors, allowing for effective and efficient testing.
