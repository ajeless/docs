## The 3 Axes of Software Testing

Software testing is a vast domain, and understanding its different dimensions is crucial for effective testing. The three primary axes of software testing are:

1. **Depth of Testing**
    - **Unit Testing**: Focuses on individual units or components of a software. It is the first level of testing and is often performed by developers.
    - **Integration Testing**: Ensures that integrated components or systems work together as expected.
    - **System Testing**: Validates the complete and fully integrated software product to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
    - **Acceptance Testing**: Determines if the software is ready for release and meets the business needs.
    - **End-to-End Testing**: Validates the flow of an application from start to finish ensuring that the entire process of inputs, outputs, and execution behaves as expected.

2. **Breadth of Testing**
    - **Functional Testing**: Validates that the software performs its intended functions correctly.
    - **Non-functional Testing**: Assesses non-functional aspects such as performance, usability, security, etc.
    - **Regression Testing**: Ensures that new code changes have not adversely affected existing functionalities.
    - **Smoke Testing**: A preliminary test to check the basic functionalities of an application.

3. **Duration of Testing**
    - **Static Testing**: Involves reviewing the software documentation and code without executing the program. Examples include code reviews and static code analysis.
    - **Dynamic Testing**: Involves executing the software and analyzing the output. It includes most types of functional and non-functional testing.

By understanding and leveraging these three axes, testers can ensure comprehensive coverage and high-quality software delivery.
