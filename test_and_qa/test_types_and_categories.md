18. **Alpha Testing**: Conducted by the internal teams after the development phase. It's dynamic validation testing in a controlled environment.
19. **Beta Testing**: Performed by real users in a real environment before the software release. This is dynamic validation testing.
20. **Database Testing**: Validates the database functions, triggers, procedures, etc. It's dynamic validation testing for database integrity.
21. **GUI Testing**: Tests the graphical user interface of the software. This is dynamic validation testing for the user interface.
22. **API Testing**: Validates the application programming interfaces. It's dynamic validation testing for backend services.
23. **Boundary Testing**: Tests the behavior of the software at boundary limits. This is dynamic validation testing for input boundaries.
24. **Monkey Testing**: Random testing without any predefined test cases or scripts. It's a form of dynamic validation testing.
25. **Error Handling Testing**: Checks how the software handles errors. This is dynamic validation testing for error conditions.
26. **Localization/Globalization Testing**: Ensures the software works for specific locales or cultures. This is dynamic validation testing for internationalization.
27. **Installation Testing**: Validates the installation process of the software. It's dynamic validation testing for the installation process.
28. **Recovery Testing**: Checks how the software recovers from crashes or failures. This is dynamic validation testing for system recovery.
29. **Reliability Testing**: Assesses the software's reliability and stability over time. It's dynamic validation testing for system consistency.
30. **Failover Testing**: Validates the system's ability to allocate resources in case of failure. This is dynamic validation testing for system resilience.
31. **Compatibility Testing**: Ensures the software works in different environments and configurations. This is dynamic validation testing for compatibility.
32. **Conformance Testing**: Validates the software against defined standards or specifications. This is dynamic validation testing against standards.
33. **Operational Testing**: Tests the software's operational readiness in a production environment. This is dynamic validation testing for operational readiness.
34. **Static Testing**: Reviews the software documentation for errors. This is static verification testing, often done without executing the code.
35. **Dynamic Testing**: Tests the software by executing it. This involves running the software and validating its behavior.
36. **Compliance Testing**: Ensures the

 software adheres to specific standards or regulations. This is dynamic validation testing for regulatory compliance.
37. **A/B Testing**: Compares two versions of the software to determine which one performs better. This is dynamic validation testing for optimization.
38. **Mutation Testing**: Modifies the software's source code to check if the existing tests can detect the changes. This is dynamic verification testing for test coverage.
39. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensures the software can be used by people with disabilities. This is dynamic validation testing for accessibility standards.
40. **Fuzz Testing**: Sends random, malformed data to software components to find vulnerabilities. This is dynamic validation testing for unexpected inputs.
41. **Destructive Testing**: Intentionally causes the software to fail to determine its robustness. This is dynamic validation testing for system robustness.
42. **Content Testing**: Validates the content for its correctness, readability, and usability. This is dynamic validation testing for content accuracy.
43. **Interoperability Testing**: Ensures that the software can operate with other products or systems. This is dynamic validation testing for system interactions.
44. **Configuration Testing**: Validates the software's behavior under different configurations. This is dynamic validation testing for configuration scenarios.
45. **Parallel Testing**: Compares the results of a new system against an existing system. This is dynamic validation testing for system comparison.
46. **Backward Compatibility Testing**: Ensures new versions of the software remain compatible with older versions. This is dynamic validation testing for version compatibility.
47. **Risk-Based Testing**: Prioritizes testing based on the potential risks of software failures. This is dynamic validation testing based on risk assessment.
48. **Shadow Testing**: Runs two systems simultaneously for comparison, usually an old system against a new one. This is dynamic validation testing for system comparison.
49. **Review**: A static verification activity where the software artifacts (like requirements, design, and code) are examined by individuals or a group to identify defects and provide feedback.
    - **Peer Review**: Team members review each other's work.
    - **Walkthrough**: The author of the artifact under review presents it to colleagues and gathers feedback.
    - **Formal Inspection**: A structured process with predefined roles (like moderator, author, and reviewer) to identify defects in the artifact.
50. **Static Analysis**: A static verification activity where tools are used to analyze code (or sometimes design) to detect potential vulnerabilities, code violations, and defects without actually executing the code.
51. **Traceability Analysis**: A static verification activity that ensures requirements are traceable to corresponding design elements and code, ensuring completeness.
52. **Modeling and Simulation**: Using models to represent software behavior or system interactions and simulating their behavior. This is a form of static validation.
