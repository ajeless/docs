## E
- **Effective Error:** An error that results in a noticeable system failure or deviation from expected behavior. Unlike latent errors, effective errors manifest as active failures.
- **Equivalence Partitioning:** A method of dividing the input data of a software unit into partitions of equivalent data from which test cases can be derived.
- **Error:** A part of the system or service that can lead to failure, often related to a segment of the software product's code.
- **Error Forecasting:** A way of measuring how likely we are to have failures based on the behavior of the program.
- **Error Removal:** The process of getting rid of the errors themselves, often through verification.
- **Exhaustive Testing:** A testing approach where all possible inputs, paths, and scenarios in a software application are tested. It's often impractical due to the vast number of possible combinations.

## F
- **Fake:** Working implementations with shortcuts unsuitable for production.
- **Failure:** The unwanted effects that occur when the delivered service deviates from the specification of the expected service. It is the inability of the software to perform as intended.
- **Fault Avoidance:** Preventing, by construction, certain kinds of faults. Some programming languages have built-in fault avoidance mechanisms.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Having redundant subsystems such that one of them can fail and the rest will continue to operate.
- **Fault/Defect/Bug:** The root cause of an error. Faults can arise from poor requirements specification, design flaws, manufacturing defects, hardware wear and tear, and coding mistakes in software, and usually lead to unexpected behavior.

## G
- **Grey Box Testing:** A software testing method that combines both black box and white box testing techniques. In this method, the tester has partial knowledge of the software's internal workings.

## I
- **Integrity:** The absence of improper system alteration.

- **Mutation Testing:** A method of software testing where certain statements of the source code are changed/mutated to check if the test cases are able to find the errors.

## P

- **Post-mortem Testing:** A process of analyzing the software after it has been executed to determine the causes of any failures.
- **Pesticide Paradox:** The phenomenon where the same set of tests, when executed repeatedly, will no longer find new defects. To overcome this, tests need to be regularly reviewed and revised.
