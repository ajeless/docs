# Test Engineering and Quality Assurance

## Software Testing

**Definition**:
Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets specified requirements and functions correctly. It involves executing a software component or system component to evaluate one or more properties of interest. The main objective of software testing is to identify defects, errors, or other issues that might adversely affect the functionality, performance, or usability of the software.

### Reasons Why We Do Software Testing:

1. **Ensure Quality**: Testing ensures that the software meets the quality standards and performs as expected. It helps in verifying that the software functions correctly and meets user requirements.

2. **Identify Defects**: Through testing, defects or bugs in the software can be identified and rectified before the software is released to the end-users.

3. **Reduce Risks**: By identifying issues early in the development process, testing helps in reducing the risks associated with software failures, which can lead to financial losses, reputation damage, or even legal liabilities.

4. **Increase User Satisfaction**: A well-tested software provides a better user experience, leading to increased user satisfaction and trust in the product.

5. **Cost-Efficiency**: Detecting and fixing defects early in the development lifecycle is less expensive than addressing them after the software is in production.

6. **Ensure Compatibility**: Testing ensures that the software is compatible across different devices, browsers, operating systems, and network environments.

7. **Validate Software Performance**: Performance testing ensures that the software operates smoothly under expected loads and doesn't suffer from issues like slow response times or crashes.

8. **Regulatory Compliance**: In certain industries, software must meet specific regulatory standards. Testing ensures that the software complies with these regulations.

9. **Build Confidence**: Testing provides confidence to stakeholders, developers, and users that the software is reliable and can be trusted.

10. **Support Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automated testing supports CI/CD processes, allowing for faster and more frequent releases.
