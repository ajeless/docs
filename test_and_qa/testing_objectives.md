# Objectives of Software Testing

Software testing serves multiple objectives that contribute to overall quality and reliability, while also imparting confidence to the software development team:

- **Verification and Validation of Requirements**: Ensuring software applications meet stakeholder-defined requirements and specifications.
- **Defect Identification and Resolution**: Identifying and addressing defects and errors to enhance software quality.
- **Assessment of Non-Functional Attributes**: Evaluating attributes like usability, performance, security, and compliance with industry standards.
- **Ensuring Compliance**: Verifying software compliance with industry standards, legal requirements, and best practices.
- **Confidence to Develop Software Faster**: Imparting confidence to the software development team, allowing them to move quickly and efficiently in the development process.

By conducting thorough testing, development teams gain assurance that their code functions as intended, which in turn, enables a smoother and more agile development cycle.
