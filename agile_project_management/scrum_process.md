# Scrum Project Planning and Execution Process

## 1. Establish a Vision
- **Purpose**: The vision acts as a guiding map for the project, detailing the direction and desired outcome.
- **Importance**: It ensures that everyone, from stakeholders to team members, understands the project's goals and direction.
- **Outcome**: A clear and shared understanding of the project's end goal.

## 2. Define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- **Purpose**: To develop a product with just enough features to satisfy early adopters and gather feedback.
- **Benefits**: MVP allows for quick market testing, minimizes scope creep, and ensures faster user feedback.
- **Outcome**: A product with essential features ready for market testing.

## 3. Decompose the Vision
- **Themes**: Broad categories or groupings of work that represent major functionalities or areas of the product.
- **Features**: More specific functionalities or tasks within each theme.
- **Outcome**: A structured breakdown of the project into manageable parts.

## 4. Develop User Stories
- **Definition**: Descriptive narratives that detail how users will interact with the product.
- **INVEST Criteria**: A guideline to ensure stories are:
  - **Independent**: Each story should stand on its own, without dependencies on other stories. This allows for flexibility in the development process and reduces complexities.
  - **Negotiable**: Until a story is part of the current sprint, its details can be changed. This ensures that the team and stakeholders can adapt to changing requirements or new information.
  - **Valuable**: Every story should provide value to the end-users and stakeholders. This ensures that the team's efforts are always aligned with the project's goals.
  - **Estimable**: The team should be able to estimate the effort required for a story. This ensures proper planning and resource allocation.
  - **Small**: Stories should be small enough to be completed within a single sprint. This ensures that the team can deliver regular increments of the product.
  - **Testable**: Each story should have clear criteria that can be tested. This ensures that the delivered feature meets the desired quality standards.
- **Acceptance Criteria (AC)**: Specific benchmarks that determine when a user story is considered complete.
- **Outcome**: A set of clear, valuable, and achievable tasks for the development team.

## 5. Determine Boundaries
- **Definition of Done**: A set of criteria that all user stories must meet to be considered complete.
- **Backlog Prioritization**: Organizing user stories by importance or value to the project.
- **Sprint Cadence**: Setting a consistent duration for sprints, typically ranging from one to four weeks.
- **Outcome**: A clear framework for the development process.

## 6. Estimation
- **Relative Estimation**: A method of comparing user stories to each other to gauge their relative size or complexity.
- **Planning Poker**: A collaborative estimation technique where team members use cards to vote on the size of a user story.
- **Outcome**: An understanding of the effort required for each user story.

## 7. Create a Roadmap
- **Purpose**: A high-level timeline that lays out the major themes and features over time.
- **Benefits**: Provides stakeholders with a general sense of the project's direction and milestones.
- **Outcome**: A visual representation of the project's trajectory.

## 8. Develop a Release Plan
- **Purpose**: To connect the roadmap to sprints, organizing user stories around theme timelines.
- **Benefits**: Provides a more detailed plan for project delivery over time.
- **Outcome**: A clear sequence of sprints and releases.

## 9. Execution and Feedback
- **Iterative Development**: The practice of delivering work in short, consistent cycles known as sprints.
- **Feedback Loops**: Mechanisms for gathering continuous feedback during the sprint, allowing for adjustments and improvements.
- **Outcome**: Regularly delivered increments of the product and continuous improvement.

## Understand the Scrum Framework
- **Scrum Team**: Comprises the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers, each with specific roles and responsibilities.
- **Scrum Events and Artifacts**: Essential components of the Scrum process, as defined in The Scrum Guide.
- **Empirical Process**: Scrum's foundation, emphasizing observation, experience, and experimentation with three pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

## Embrace Scrum Values
- **Trust**: Essential for effective collaboration and successful Scrum implementation.
- **Scrum Values**: Guiding principles including Courage, Focus, Commitment, Respect, and Openness that shape team behavior and interactions.

## Professional Scrum
- **Beyond Mechanics**: Effective Scrum requires more than just following the framework's mechanics; it demands a change in mindset and work culture.
- **Environment**: An environment that fosters trust, collaboration, and adherence to Scrum values is crucial.

## Detailed Example: Building a Fitness Mobile App

### Introduction
Imagine a startup company named "FitLife" that aims to develop a mobile app to help users track their daily physical activities and set fitness goals.

### 1. Establish a Vision
FitLife's vision is to create an intuitive mobile app that allows users to monitor their daily steps, set weekly fitness goals, and view their progress over time. The app aims to motivate users to lead a healthier lifestyle.

### 2. Define the MVP
The MVP for the FitLife app includes:
- User registration and profile creation.
- Step counting feature using the phone's sensors.
- Goal setting for weekly steps.
- A progress dashboard showing daily and weekly step counts.

### 3. Decompose the Vision
- **Themes**: User Profile, Activity Tracking, Goal Setting, Progress Dashboard.
- **Features**:
  - User Profile: Registration, Login, Profile Editing.
  - Activity Tracking: Daily step counting, Historical data view.
  - Goal Setting: Set weekly step goals.
  - Progress Dashboard: View daily and weekly progress, Achievements.

### 4. Develop User Stories
- **User Profile**:
  - As a new user, I want to register so that I can use the FitLife app.
  - As a registered user, I want to log in so that I can track my activities.
  - As a user, I want to edit my profile to update my personal information.
- **Activity Tracking**:
  - As a user, I want the app to count my daily steps so that I can monitor my physical activity.
  - As a user, I want to view my historical step data to see my activity trends over time.
- **Goal Setting**:
  - As a user, I want to set weekly step goals to challenge myself and stay motivated.
- **Progress Dashboard**:
  - As a user, I want to view my daily and weekly step counts to track my progress.
  - As a user, I want to earn achievements for reaching certain milestones to keep me motivated.

### 5. Determine Boundaries
- **Definition of Done**:
  - For the step counting feature, the app should accurately count steps within a 5% margin of error.
  - For the registration feature, users should receive a confirmation email.
- **Backlog Prioritization**:
  - The step counting feature is the highest priority because it's the core functionality of the app.
  - The progress dashboard is the next priority to provide users with feedback on their activity.

### 6. Estimation
Using the Planning Poker technique, the development team estimates the effort required for each user story. For instance:
- User registration: 3 story points.
- Step counting: 8 story points.
- Goal setting: 2 story points.

### 7. Create a Roadmap
The roadmap outlines the development and release of features over the next three months:
- Month 1: User registration and profile creation.
- Month 2: Step counting and historical data view.
- Month 3: Goal setting and progress dashboard.

### 8. Develop a Release Plan
The release plan breaks down the roadmap into two-week sprints:
- Sprint 1: Design and develop the user registration feature.
- Sprint 2: Test and release the user registration feature; start developing the step counting feature.
- Sprint 3: Complete the step counting feature and start the historical data view.
- Sprint 4: Complete the historical data view and start the goal setting feature.

### 9. Execution and Feedback
During each sprint, the development team follows the Scrum framework, holding daily stand-up meetings, reviewing progress, and gathering feedback. At the end of each sprint, they hold a sprint review and retrospective to discuss what went well and what can be improved.

### Understand the Scrum Framework
