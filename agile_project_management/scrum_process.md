# Scrum Project Planning and Execution Process

## 1. Establish a Vision
- **Purpose**: The vision acts as a guiding map for the project, detailing the direction and desired outcome.
- **Importance**: It ensures that everyone, from stakeholders to team members, understands the project's goals and direction.
- **Outcome**: A clear and shared understanding of the project's end goal.

## 2. Define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- **Purpose**: To develop a product with just enough features to satisfy early adopters and gather feedback.
- **Benefits**: MVP allows for quick market testing, minimizes scope creep, and ensures faster user feedback.
- **Outcome**: A product with essential features ready for market testing.

## 3. Decompose the Vision
- **Themes**: Broad categories or groupings of work that represent major functionalities or areas of the product.
- **Features**: More specific functionalities or tasks within each theme.
- **Outcome**: A structured breakdown of the project into manageable parts.

## 4. Develop User Stories
- **Definition**: Descriptive narratives that detail how users will interact with the product.
- **INVEST Criteria**: A guideline to ensure stories are:
  - **I**ndependent: Each story should stand on its own, without dependencies on other stories. This allows for flexibility in the development process and reduces complexities.
  - **N**egotiable: Until a story is part of the current sprint, its details can be changed. This ensures that the team and stakeholders can adapt to changing requirements or new information.
  - **V**aluable: Every story should provide value to the end-users and stakeholders. This ensures that the team's efforts are always aligned with the project's goals.
  - **E**stimable: The team should be able to estimate the effort required for a story. This ensures proper planning and resource allocation.
  - **S**mall: Stories should be small enough to be completed within a single sprint. This ensures that the team can deliver regular increments of the product.
  - **T**estable: Each story should have clear criteria that can be tested. This ensures that the delivered feature meets the desired quality standards.
- **Acceptance Criteria (AC)**: Specific benchmarks that determine when a user story is considered complete.
- **Outcome**: A set of clear, valuable, and achievable tasks for the development team.

## 5. Determine Boundaries
- **Definition of Done**: A set of criteria that all user stories must meet to be considered complete.
- **Backlog Prioritization**: Organizing user stories by importance or value to the project.
- **Sprint Cadence**: Setting a consistent duration for sprints, typically ranging from one to four weeks.
- **Outcome**: A clear framework for the development process.

## 6. Estimation
- **Relative Estimation**: A method of comparing user stories to each other to gauge their relative size or complexity.
- **Planning Poker**: A collaborative estimation technique where team members use cards to vote on the size of a user story.
- **Outcome**: An understanding of the effort required for each user story.

## 7. Create a Roadmap
- **Purpose**: A high-level timeline that lays out the major themes and features over time.
- **Benefits**: Provides stakeholders with a general sense of the project's direction and milestones.
- **Outcome**: A visual representation of the project's trajectory.

## 8. Develop a Release Plan
- **Purpose**: To connect the roadmap to sprints, organizing user stories around theme timelines.
- **Benefits**: Provides a more detailed plan for project delivery over time.
- **Outcome**: A clear sequence of sprints and releases.

## 9. Execution and Feedback
- **Iterative Development**: The practice of delivering work in short, consistent cycles known as sprints.
- **Feedback Loops**: Mechanisms for gathering continuous feedback during the sprint, allowing for adjustments and improvements.
- **Outcome**: Regularly delivered increments of the product and continuous improvement.

## Understand the Scrum Framework
- **Scrum Team**: Comprises the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers, each with specific roles and responsibilities.
- **Scrum Events and Artifacts**: Essential components of the Scrum process, as defined in The Scrum Guide.
- **Empirical Process**: Scrum's foundation, emphasizing observation, experience, and experimentation with three pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

## Embrace Scrum Values
- **Trust**: Essential for effective collaboration and successful Scrum implementation.
- **Scrum Values**: Guiding principles including Courage, Focus, Commitment, Respect, and Openness that shape team behavior and interactions.

## Professional Scrum
- **Beyond Mechanics**: Effective Scrum requires more than just following the framework's mechanics; it demands a change in mindset and work culture.
- **Environment**: An environment that fosters trust, collaboration, and adherence to Scrum values is crucial.
