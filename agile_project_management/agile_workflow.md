# Organizational Hierarchy, Agile Workflow, Milestones, and Methodologies

In this integrated hierarchy, we start from the broad organizational purpose and drill down to the specific work items and quality assurance processes. This flow ensures that every piece of work, from high-level strategic objectives to day-to-day tasks and testing, aligns with the company's broader purpose and objectives, ensuring quality and user satisfaction.

## Purpose
- **Definition:** The fundamental reason the company exists.
- **Example:** "To empower individuals through technology."
- **Methodology to Next Step:** Alignment with Company Values.

## Vision
- **Definition:** The aspirational future state of the company.
- **Example:** "A world where everyone has access to cutting-edge technological tools."
- **Methodology to Next Step:** Goal Setting Frameworks (e.g., OKRs, SMART Goals).

## Mission
- **Definition:** Describes the company's current state and how it operates to achieve its vision.
- **Example:** "To design and distribute innovative tech solutions that enhance daily life."

## Values
- **Definition:** Core principles guiding behavior and decision-making.
- **Example:** Integrity, Innovation, Collaboration, User-Centricity.
- **Methodology to Next Step:** Goal Setting Frameworks (e.g., OKRs, SMART Goals).

## Goals/Strategic Objectives
- **Definition:** High-level targets derived from the mission and vision.
- **Example:** "Launch three new products this year to increase our market share by 15%."
- **Methodology to Next Step:** Impact Mapping.

## Milestones
- **Definition:** Significant events or markers in a project timeline.
- **Example:** "Completion of the first product prototype", "Achieving 50% of the annual sales target."
- **Methodology to Next Step:** Review and Adjust based on Progress and Feedback.

## Initiatives
- **Definition:** Large-scale efforts undertaken to achieve specific goals.
- **Example:** "Develop a new line of wearable tech."
- **Methodology to Next Step:** User Story Mapping and Product Roadmapping.

## Epics
- **Definition:** Large user or business requirements that can be broken down into smaller user stories or features.
- **Example:** "Integrate AI capabilities into our wearable tech line."
- **Methodology to Next Step:** Product Roadmapping and Prioritization Techniques (e.g., MoSCoW, RICE Scoring).

## Features/User Stories
- **Definition:** Represents a requirement from a user's perspective.
- **Example:** "As a user, I want the wearable device to track my heart rate so I can monitor my health."
- **Methodology to Next Step:** Detailed Requirement Gathering and Acceptance Criteria Definition.

## Requirements
- **Definition:** Detailed descriptions of the system's behavior, constraints, or attributes.
- **Example:** "The device must capture heart rate data every second and display it in real-time."
- **Methodology to Next Step:** Task Decomposition.

## Tasks
- **Definition:** Specific work items or activities that need to be completed to fulfill a user story or feature.
- **Example:** "Design the UI for the heart rate display", "Develop the algorithm for heart rate tracking."
- **Methodology to Next Step:** Development and Testing Cycle.

## Testing
- **Definition:** The process of evaluating a system or its component(s) to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements.
  - **Manual Testing:** Conducted by testers manually without the use of automation tools.
    - **Example:** A tester wears the device and checks if the heart rate is displayed in real-time.
  - **Automated Testing:** Uses scripts and tools to run tests.
    - **Example:** A script simulates heart rate data input and checks if the display updates every second.
- **Methodology to Next Step:** Bug Tracking and Resolution.

## Bugs/Defects
- **Definition:** Issues or problems identified in the product.
- **Example:** "Heart rate display freezes when the device is paired with a smartphone."

## Tickets
- **Definition:** Often used interchangeably with tasks or bugs.
- **Example:** "Ticket #12345: Fix synchronization issue between wearable device and smartphone app."
