### What is a vector?

A vector is a mathematical entity/object that have both a mangitude (eg: quantity or length) and direction. Vectors can not be fully described using just a magnitude. Vectors can be thought of as arrows where the length represents that magnitude and their direction is the direction that they point in. Vectors are often represented in various ways.

Sometimes as a variable or letter with an arrow on top such as

$$
    \vec{\beta}
$$$ with an arrow on top

Sometimes as a list such as


$$

    \alpha = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ \vdots \\ c_n \end{bmatrix}

$$

### What is a scalar?

A scalar is a single element of a field, typically a real ($ \real $) or a complex ($ \Complex $) number. A scalar is a constant that is used to multiply (scale) a vector. Hence the term scalar. A vector multiplied by a scalar is "scaled" (it's magnitude increased or decreased) by the scalar. Scalars are fully described by a magnitude (a quantity or a number).

### What is a linear equation?

A linear equation is an equation that forms a straight line when graphed. It represents a relationship in which each term is either a constant (called a coefficient/scalar), or a constant multiplied by a single, first-order (linear) term (called a variable or an unknown). The general form of a linear equation is:


$$

\begin{equation}
a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = b
\end{equation}

$$

where:
$a_1, a_2, ... , a_n$ are constants (coefficients)
$x_1, a_x, ... , x_n$ are variables (unknowns)
$b$ is a constant

### What is linear algebra?

Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that studies vectors, vector spaces, linear combinations, linear transformations, systems of equations, matrices, and the operations that act on these objects.

### What is a matrix?

A matrix (over the field $F$) is a rectangular array of elements of $F$. The elements of $F$ that occur in the matrix $A$ are called the entries of $A$. Matrices generally look something like this:


$$

A*{m,n} =
\begin{pmatrix}
a*{1,1} & a*{1,2} & \cdots & a*{1,n} \\
a*{2,1} & a*{2,2} & \cdots & a*{2,n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a*{m,1} & a*{m,2} & \cdots & a*{m,n}
\end{pmatrix}

$$
