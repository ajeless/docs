### What is a scalar?

A scalar is a single element of a field, typically a real ($ \real $) or a complex ($ \Complex $) number. A scalar is a constant that is used to multiply (scale) a vector. Hence the term scalar. A vector multiplied by a scalar is "scaled" (it's magnitude increased or decreased) by the scalar.

### What is a linear equation?

A linear equation is an equation that forms a straight line when graphed. It represents a relationship in which each term is either a constant (called a coefficient/scalar), or a constant multiplied by a single, first-order (linear) term (called a variable or an unknown). The general form of a linear equation is:

$$
\begin{equation}
    a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = b
\end{equation}
$$

where:  
$ a_1, a_2, ... , a_n $ are constants (coefficients)  
$ x_1, a_x, ... , x_n $ are variables (unknowns)  
$ b $ is a constant
